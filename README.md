# quantstats_test

This is meant to be a demo and testing zone for Quantstats Package 

Findings so far...

*Quantstats is great to get stats and graphs from any series of data
*Relatively fast and has a large number of functions we can use to generate stats 
*Poor documentation right now, need to look at source code to figure out what to do
*Quantstats also has a create index function which works for the backtesting we need to do, this allows for reblancing and tickers with allocations. The only thing this can't do right now is the rebalance threshold.
